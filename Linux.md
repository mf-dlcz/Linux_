- **Modular**  Option to download only the modules needed.
- **Extensible** Ability to modify and extend its functionality by contributing their own code.
- **Community Support** Access to various forums to resolve issues.

## Architecture:

ðŸ’¡ Linux OS is made up of user space and a kernel space.

- The **kernel** is made up of the core operating system functionality and acts  
as the bridge between the software and hardware components.

- The **user space** is the area where the applications and programs run on the OS.

        - /dev/sda1
        - /dev/sda2


## Directory Structure

- The root directory (**/**) contains every other directory in the Linux operating system.
- The **/bin** directory contains compiled programs (binaries) ready to run.
- The **/lib** directory contains libraries needed by programs in **/bin**.
- The **/home** directory contains a home folder for each user.
- The **/usr** directory contains user applications and files.
- The **/tmp** directory is used for temporary files that will be deleted when the system is restarted.
- The **/var** directory contains variable data files. For example, log files are written to the /var/log directory.
- The **/boot** directory contains files like the kernel needed to boot the system.
- The **/etc** directory contains system configuration files.
