# Summary

A Bash script is a plain text file containing a series of commands in the Bash programming language. Bash scripts start  
with a **shebang** line. Its purpose is to provide a path to the interpreter, indicating the location of the Bash shell in your system.
```
#!/bin/bash
```

Set the execute (run) permission for your script file using the **chmod** command.
```
chmod +x practice
```

Run a file using the **'./'** notation followed by its name.
```
./practice
```
