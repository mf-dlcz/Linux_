# Troubleshooting Overview
Scripts with errors can lead to unintended consequences, such as applications not working as expected, system instability and data loss.

## Troubleshooting Scripts
Involves analyzing errors, logs and script behavior to determine the root causes of problems.

- **Understanding error messages:** Interpret error messages, and exit codes to determine the nature of the issue.
- **Logging:** Use logging mechanisms to capture relevant information about your script performance, including errors.  
Analyzing logs can help identify patterns and recurring issues.
- **Reviewing Code:** Inspect your script's code to identify potential sources of errors, such as unhandled edge cases or incorrect assumptions.
- **Testing** Develop test cases that simulate various scenarios to validate how the script handles errors.  
Testing can help uncover hidden issues, and ensures that error handling works as expected.

## Common errors in scripting
Often revolve around syntax, logic, and file referencing errors.

### Syntax Errors
- Unclosed quotes or incorrect use of semicolons.Forgetting to close single or double quotes can lead to a syntax errors.
- Incorrect use of semicolons for command separation can also cause errors. Use semicolons to separate multiple commands on a single line, but don't forget spaces around them.
- Incorrectly referencing variables, such as missing the **$** sign, can result in errors.
