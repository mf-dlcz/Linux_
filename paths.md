# Absolute & Relative Paths:

- A path in a file system represents the sequence of directories that need to be traversed to reach a specific file or resource.  
- It defines the hierarchical structure of directories and subdirectories, starting from the root directory.  

## Absolute Paths:
- An absolute path is a complete path that specifies the exact location of a file or directory from the root directory of the file system.   
- It starts with a forward slash (/) and includes all the directories that need to be traversed to reach the desired file or directory. 
<br>

**EXAMPLE:**

/home/user/Documents/report.tx

## Relative Paths:
- A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory.  
- It does not start with a forward slash (/) and only includes the directories that need to be traversed from the current location.
<br>

**EXAMPLE:**

/home/user/Documents

<br>
